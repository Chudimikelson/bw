## Project Description
This is a single page application developed using REACT. The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). <br/> 
The application was design to give users latest updates on football league tables/standings from top tier football leagues in Europe. <br/>

Bearing in mind that this is a project required for passing a test which is time limited, some functionalities are left incomplete for future development. <br/>

It took about 4 days to get it up and running up to the minimum requirements/objectives of the test. <br/>

The most challenging aspect of this project was fetching data from football-data.org's API as this was my first time trying out the API. However, it was fun and easy as soon as i figured out how to use nested data provided in JSON format, thanks to React's state concept.
